# Creative Agency

I developed this app to train my eyes and deliver a pixel-perfect product, as per a Figma design.
This project is part of a challenge at Frontend mentor.

Challenges:

- Creating my own responsive navigation menu without using libraries or packages to respect the given design.
- Creating my own responsive slider using document.querySelector & plain Javascript.
